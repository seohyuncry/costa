            <h2><span>5. Data</span> Sharing</h2>
            <p>Costa is part of the Coca-Cola group of companies. Coca-Cola group companies may process your personal data in the course of assisting us with customer 
                information services, for instance SA Coca-Cola Services NV operates the Costa 'Ready To Drink' product customer care line and will handle enquiries and 
                concerns regarding that product as its manufacturer. Details of such enquiries and concerns will be shared with Costa if there is a specific complaint relating to 
                Costa that Coca Cola is unable to handle.</p>
            <p>For some activities Costa uses third party service providers, for instance Expo-E to provide Wi-Fi in our stores. When these service providers need customer data 
                from you, we share information with them.</p>
            <p>In addition to using the companies as described above, we use third party providers for the following services:</p>
            <p>* Wi-Fi (Expo-E)</p>
            <p>* Sending promotional offers</p>
            <p>* Customer feedback surveys</p>
            <p>* Customer service queries and complaints</p>
            <p>* Gift card and eGift services</p>
            <p>* Data analysis to enable us to optimise our services (including locations and products) Gift cards (including eGifts)</p>
            <p>* Loyalty scheme platform</p>
            <p>* Insurance</p>
            <p>* IT development, support, maintenance and hosting, including the provision of applications and website hosting</p>
            <p>* Payments’ processing to enable you to pay by credit or debit card</p>
            <p>* CCTV system provision and maintenance</p>
            <p>* Administration of our competitions and awards.</p>
            <p>We may also share data with Social Networks (e.g. Facebook).</p>
            <p>If our business is to be integrated with another business or sold, your details would be shared with our advisers and any prospective purchaser’s advisers. Your 
                information could also be passed to the new owners (you will be notified if this happens).</p>
            <p>Personal data may be shared with government authorities and/or law enforcement officials for the prevention or detection of crime, if required by law or if required 
                for a legal or contractual claim.</p>

            <h2><span>6. International</span> transfers</h2>
            <p>Sometimes we send or store your data outside of the European Economic Area (the EU plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway) (‘EEA’). For example, to follow your 
                instructions, comply with a legal duty or to work with or receive services from our service providers who we use to help run your accounts and our services.</p>
            <p>If we do transfer information outside of the EEA, we will make sure that it is protected by using one of these safeguards:</p>
            <p>* Transfer it to a non-EEA country with privacy laws that give the same protection as the EEA. Some countries have been deemed adequate by the EU.</p>
            <p>* Put in place a contract with the recipient that means they must protect it to the same standards as the EEA or use other mechanisms and measures to achieve 
                adequate protection. We also may use the Standard Contractual Clauses published by the EU.</p>
            <p>* Binding corporate rules. These are internal rules adopted by group companies to allow international transfers of personal data to entities within the same 
                corporate group located in countries which do not provide an adequate level of protection.</p>
            <p>For our service provider in the US, who helps us with our customer feedback surveys, we rely on contractual measures. For our service provider in India, who has 
                restricted access to some data to provide us with IT support and maintenance services, we rely on contractual measures. For further details on the mechanisms 
                used please contact our Data Privacy team, the details are in the “Contact Us” section at the end of this policy.</p>
