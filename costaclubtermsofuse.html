            <h3>Becoming a Member, what it means <span>and 
                managing your Membership</span></h3>
            <span>Tax Policy</span>
            <p>If you have not participated in the Previous Membership Scheme, you can become a member by downloading the App and successfully completing the 
                registration process on the App (“New Member”). You are required to be over the age of 16 at the time of registration to become a New Member. New Members are 
                not entitled to a Card and can only use the App for the purposes of their Membership.</p>
            <span>Existing Members</span>
            <p>If you were a member of the Previous Membership Scheme (“Existing Member”), then your existing membership shall continue in full force and effect but in 
                accordance with these Terms and Conditions.</p>
            <p>Existing Members who used Cards for the Previous Membership Scheme can continue to use their same Card from the Previous Membership Scheme. Existing 
                Members who use Cards can also use the App for the purposes of their Membership. Please contact Customer services via our contact form if your card is lost 
                or stolen.</p>
            <span>What Membership means</span>
            <p>Both New Members and Existing Members who transfer to the Membership shall be “Members” for the purposes of these Terms and Conditions. New Members 
                become Members when they have completed the registration process to join the Membership and been accepted as Members by us. The Existing Members’ 
                membership shall transfer to the Membership and the introduction of the Membership shall be a continuation of the Existing Membership as amended by these 
                Terms and Conditions. Your Membership can only be registered in the name of an individual and an individual may only register one Membership.</p>
            <p>Your Membership enables you to earn virtual stamps (“Beans”) on the App and/or your Card (if applicable). Once you have earned ten Beans (the “Threshold”), 
                you will receive a reward (“Reward”) which can be redeemed in accordance with the ‘Redeeming Rewards’ section below in participating Costa outlets in Great 
                Britain, available here. You can also earn Beans on purchases made from Costa Express machines located in Great Britain, but you will not be able to redeem a 
                Reward from a Costa Express machine.</p>
            <span>Managing your Membership</span>
            <p>You shall be able to manage their Membership on the Website and/or the App. If you are a Member who uses a Card, you must have registered your Card before 
                being able to manage your Membership. Managing your Membership includes being able to update your personal information (including adding or amending 
                your date of birth) and changing your communication preferences.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Earning Beans and <span>redeeming Rewards</span></h3>
            <span>Earning Beans</span>
            <p>Beans can only be earned in-store at the time of purchase and only if the QR Code on your App is scanned at the point of purchase or (if applicable) your Card is 
                presented at the time of payment. Beans can also be earned automatically when mobile ordering.</p>
            <p>Cards cannot be used to collect Beans in relation to purchases made from Costa Express machines. To collect Beans on purchases made from a Costa Express 
                machine, you will need to scan a QR code with the App on the Costa Express machine.</p>
            <p>You will earn one (1) Bean for each:</p>
            <p>(i) handcrafted drink (i.e. any handcrafted drink which is on the menu board at a Costa outlet (“Handcrafted Drink”) purchased from a participating Costa outlet in 
                Great Britain;<br>
                (ii) bundle deal drink (i.e. any drink which is included in any bundle deal) purchased from a participating Costa outlet in Great Britain;<br>
                (iii) each drink purchased from a Costa Express machine in Great Britain; and<br>
                (iv) any drinks purchased at (i) to (iii) above (inclusive) via Click & Collect and/or Contactless Ordering (see Contactless Ordering and Click & Collect sections 
                below), each a “Eligible Drink” and together the “Eligible Drinks”.</p>
            <p>For the avoidance of doubt, if a Member purchases multiple Eligible Drinks in one transaction, the Member will receive the number of Beans which corresponds with 
                the total number of Eligible Drinks purchased. Earning of Beans is not limited to one Bean per transaction.</p>
            <p>You can also earn:</p>
            <p>(i) one additional (1) Bean for each Handcrafted Drink purchased from a participating Costa outlet in Great Britain using a suitable reusable cup. Only reusable 
                cups that are clean, of an appropriate size for the purchased barista prepared drink and with a secure lid will be accepted. The store manager's decision as to the 
                acceptability of any cup will be final;<br>
                (ii) (if you are a New Member) one (1) Bean when you successfully complete registration of your Membership on the App; and<br>
                (iii) five (5) Beans if you successfully refer a friend in accordance with the Costa Club: Refer a Friend Terms and Conditions.</p>
            <p>Beans cannot be earned:</p>
            <p>(i) on purchases of any items other than Eligible Drinks;<br>
                (ii) on Eligible Drinks purchased using a Reward;<br>
                (iii) when purchasing gift cards; and<br>
                (iv) in conjunction with any discount or privilege card whether issued by us or by any third party</p>
            <p>If you have not used the App and/or (if applicable) your Card to earn Beans and/or redeem Rewards in the past twelve (12) months, all your Beans which have not 
                been converted to Rewards will expire.</p>
            <span>Redeeming Rewards</span>
            <p>Once you have earned the number of Beans equal to the Threshold, those Beans will be automatically converted into a Reward on the App or (if applicable) on 
                your Card. Rewards are valid for three months from the date on which they are issued. You can check the number of Beans you have earned and the number of 
                Rewards you have at any participating Costa outlet or by checking the Website or the App.</p>
            <p>Beans and Rewards have no cash value. Beans and Rewards can only be earned, held and redeemed as set out in these Terms and Conditions. Any Beans or 
                Rewards obtained or used otherwise than in accordance with these Terms and Conditions will be invalid and cannot be redeemed. Beans are personal to you and 
                cannot be pooled with Beans earned by another Member and redeemed together.</p>
            <p>In order to redeem a Reward in-store, you will need to scan the QR Code at the point of purchase using the App and/or (if applicable) provide your Card and state 
                that you would like to redeem your Reward. When using Click and Collect, you can redeem a Reward by selecting it as a payment option. Multiple Rewards 
                (provided they are personal to you) can be redeemed in the same transaction (whether in-store or when using Click and Collect).</p>
            <p>You may only redeem Rewards against purchases of Handcrafted Drinks (including up to 5 add-ons, such as syrups and additional shots but excluding flakes and 
                marshmallows) made in-store at participating Costa outlets in Great Britain or ordered using Click and Collect (see below) from a participating Costa outlet in 
                Great Britain. Rewards can be redeemed in conjunction with other rewards, discounts or promotions, unless the terms of the offer or promotion state otherwise and 
                save as set out below.</p>
            <p>Rewards cannot be:</p>
            <p>(i) used more than once;<br>
                (ii) redeemed against purchases of items other than Handcrafted Drinks made in participating Costa outlets;<br>
                (iii) redeemed against purchases of bundle deal drinks;<br>
                (iv) redeemed against purchases made from Costa Express machines;<br>
                (v) used in a manner which would entitle a Member to a promotional offer. For example, if we had a buy one get one free offer on a handcrafted coffee, the use of<br>
                the Rewards to purchase such a coffee would not entitle you to a second free coffee; or<br>
                (vi) used in conjunction with any discount or privilege card whether issued by us or by any third party.</p>

            <p>You should treat your Beans and Rewards carefully. If someone else accesses your Membership through the App, or if you lose your Card (if applicable), you may 
                lose any Beans and/or Rewards you have earned.</p>
            <p>You should immediately report any loss or theft of your Card or any fraudulent or unauthorised use of your Membership to Customer Services via the “Lost or
                damaged card” section of the website when you have logged in to your account.</p>

                App and/or your Card (if applicable). Circumstances in which we may determine, in our sole discretion, that we will not transfer and/or re-credit Beans and/or 
                Rewards include where we reasonably believe that the notified incident has been caused by your breach of these Terms and Conditions or if there are reasonable 
                grounds for suspecting that you are or have been engaged in fraudulent or other unlawful conduct in relation to your Membership.</p>
            <p>If your Card is damaged or stolen we may, in addition to re-crediting as set out above, replace your Card at our sole discretion. If we agree to replace your Card, a 
                replacement Card will be delivered to your registered home address only. We reserve the right to not replace your card in the event that you are issued with more 
                than 2 replacement Cards within any 6-month period. We will aim to have the replacement Card to you within five (5) working days. If you receive a replacement 
                Card, you will need to register it on the Website and/or the App before you can redeem any Beans and/or Rewards that have been transferred onto it. If you 
                subsequently find or retrieve a Card which you have reported lost or stolen, you must notify Customer Services immediately.</p>
