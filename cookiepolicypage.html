            <h2><span>December</span> 2021</h2>
            <p>Costa Limited respects your data and your privacy is important to us. For more information about how we use and protect data please see our Privacy Notice.</p>
            <h3>What is a cookie and what do they do?</h3>
            <p>A cookie is a small text file which sits on your device or browser and assists with information flow and functionality. We use cookies to support the main and mobile 
                websites and our app. For instance, some cookies help with site security or provide information to help us improve the site, but each cookie performs a specific 
                action. These cookies don’t usually capture your personal data and we wouldn’t be able to identify people from the information. They simply provide grouped 
                information about site or app navigation which can give you a more personalised experience and tells us if people can find what they want.</p>
            <h3>Session and persistent cookies and how long they last</h3>
            <p>All cookies are either session cookies or persistent cookies.</p>
            <p>Session cookies last for the length of your visit to a website and remember information from one page to another, so you don’t have to keep entering it .</p>
            <p>They delete themselves when you close your browser.</p>
            <p>Persistent cookies remember things for longer, from one visit to the next. They can personalise the site and remember information each time you visit. We use them 
                to see how people engage with our site to help us change and develop the site and improve your experience of it.</p>
            <p>These stay on your device when you close your browser and vary by cookie – please see the cookie table at the end for specific expiration times.</p>
            <h3>What are first and third party cookies?</h3>
            <p>Whether a cookie is first or third party depends on where it comes from and can be sent by different parties. If the cookie comes from our site it is a first party 
                cookie set by us.</p>
            <p>If it comes from another site or organisation, such as our suppliers or business partners, it is a third-party cookie, specifically chosen by us to provide a service, 
                such as a more personalised visit. For example, instance, you may be on a website that has ‘Like’ and ‘Share’ buttons for social network sites. If you click one, the 
                social network site will put a ‘third party’ cookie on your device. That cookie may then collect data about you and send it to them too. You will need to set your 
                privacy choices on their site, to tell them how they can use your data.</p>
            <h3>What different types of cookies does the site use and what are they each for?</h3>
            <p>Different types of cookies do different things. We use the following cookies on our sites and apps.</p>
            <p>Strictly Necessary Cookies - these are required for the operation, security and integrity of our website and app and are essential when you move around them and 
                use their features. For example, they remember your details when you login and allow you to access your account. Without such cookies such services cannot be 
                provided.</p>
            <p>Functional Cookies remember you when you return to the site or app and choices you have made on previous visits, such as searches and which country you’re 
                from. This allows us to improve your experience by remembering your preferences when you log into our loyalty club. These Cookies will remain on your device until 
                you choose to clear them, however, if you choose to do this, you will need to log in again into your loyalty account each time you visit the site as an example, but 
                they do eventually expire.</p>
            <p>Analytical/Performance Cookies – these allow us to anonymously count the number of visitors to our website and see how they move around and use them. This 
                helps us improve how they work, to find things easily and improve site navigation. The data is aggregated and anonymised, which means we cannot identify you 
                as an individual. Some of the Analytical Cookies we use include (but not limited to) Google Analytics and Adobe Digital Analytics.</p>
            <p>For our mobile app, your Costa Club loyalty number is used for analytical purposes to help us improve your user experience.</p>
            <h3>Marketing / Targeting cookies</h3>
            <p>These Cookies will collect information about your browsing habits and help website owners to understand the performance of their marketing activities and 
                improve the relevance of the adverts that you see. They are set by the website owner or by carefully selected third parties who may use that information to show 
                you adverts that they think you will be most interested in when you visit other websites They may also use that information to see how well their adverts are 
                performing and that information may also be shared with other parties such as advertisers. If you do not allow these cookies, you may see more content and 
                adverts that do not match your interests.</p>
            <p>Costa do not currently use these type of cookies.</p>
            <h3>What are similar technologies?</h3>
            <p>Tagging works in a similar way to cookies. We use a tag called a pixel. A pixel is an image that once imbedded in an email connects to a file stored on our web 
                server and allows us to determine customer interest in our marketing emails. Tags can also be known as beacons.</p>
            <p>These allow us to see which promotions seem of interest to our customers, and if a particular offer seems to interest you. We may use this information to send 
                offers which appear to be more relevant to you.</p>
            <h3>Do I Have to Accept Cookies?</h3>
            <p>You may reject cookies, however, site and app functions will be affected. Cookies help our sites and app to work properly and personalise your experience. You’ll be 
                able to browse the sites and app without cookies but some standard functionality, preferences and certain features will not work.</p>
            <p>By accepting cookies, you allow us to improve your experience and remember information about you, which can personalise your experience.</p>
            <p>To withdraw consent, you can reject or delete cookies. Please see the Managing Your Cookies section below on how you can adjust your browser settings.</p>
            <h3>Consent</h3>
            <p>By browsing or using our site or app you agree that we and the selected third parties in this notice can use (as described in this notice) data collected by the 
                cookies you allow. If you do not agree, you can withdraw your consent by setting your browser to reject cookies, see below.</p>
            <h3>Managing Your Cookies</h3>
            <p>There are several ways to manage cookies. You can:</p>
            <p>1. Set your browser to prevent cookies from being accepted. More information should be in your browser’s “help” menu. How to adjust your browser will depend on 
                which browser you’re using.</p>
            <p>2. Set some browsers to send you an alert when a website is trying to place a cookie on your browser.</p>
            <p>3. Block cookies by activating the setting on your browser to refuse all or some cookies. However, if you use your browser settings to block all cookies including 
                strictly necessary cookies, site access and features can be limited or not available.</p>
            <p>4. Delete cookies stored in your browser by “clearing cookies”. This will only delete cookies already stored. It won’t prevent new ones being accepted unless you 
                change the acceptance settings. Also, clearing your cookies on one browser of one device does not automatically clear them on another. You need to clear all 
                browsers on all devices, independently.</p>
            <p>5. By declining cookies in the banner that appears when you visit our site.</p>

            <h3>Multiple users</h3>
            <p>If more than one person uses your device, the choices set up by other people will apply to you as well unless you change them. For example, if you share a 
                computer with your family, you may see ads based on sites they have visited as well as sites you have visited.</p>
            <h3>Cookies that are already on your device</h3>
            <p>Turning off one or more types of cookies will not delete any that have been downloaded in the past.</p>

            <p>Cookies and similar technology used by us are listed below.</p>
            <h3>Cookie List</h3>
            <p>A cookie is a small piece of data (text file) that a website – when visited by a user – asks your browser to store on your device in order to remember information 
                about you, such as your language preference or login information. Those cookies are set by us and called first-party cookies. We also use third-party cookies – 
                which are cookies from a domain different than the domain of the website you are visiting – for our advertising and marketing efforts. More specifically, we use 
                cookies and other tracking technologies for the following purposes:</p>
            <span>Strictly Necessary Cookies</span>
            <p>These cookies are necessary for the operation, security and integrity of our website and app and are essential when you move around them and use their features, 
                so cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting 
                your privacy preferences, filling in forms or logging in to access your account. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts 
                of the site or services will not then work.</p>
