            <p>The packaging we serve our products in is really important to us, to you, and for the planet. That’s why we will continue to prioritise the sustainability of our 
                packaging, including our takeaway cups, lids, cans and pods.</p>
            <p>Wherever possible we will create circular solutions, considering the entire lifecycle of each piece of packaging – reducing waste, boosting recycling, and using 
                recycled material – moving towards reuse as our ultimate goal.</p>

                        <p>Our takeaway cup is made from 100% plant-based renewable materials. 
                            Costa has taken steps to reduce the environmental impact of takeout 
                            cups. Since November 2022, we've changed our inner lining to plant-
                            based plastics rather than petroleum-based plastics.</p>

                            recyclable. This encourages customers to recycle paper takeout cups 
                            in Costa stores.</p>

                            than 50% recycled content on average. And Costa Coffee changed the 
                            size of the cup with the launch of a small cup. The chain's existing small 
                            cups are classified as medium, the existing medium is large, and the 
                            existing large is classified as extra large.</p>

                    <h2>Testing reusable <span>cup schemes</span></h2>
                    <p>In 2022 we ran a trial of our very own reusable cup scheme called ‘BURT’: standing for ‘Borrow, Use, Reuse, Take back’. It was our first trial of an integrated on-the-go
                        reusable cup scheme and ran across 14 stores in Glasgow.</p>
                    <p>Customers could borrow a reusable cup, use it, reuse it, and take it back to a store for it to be washed before being used again. Not only did this help customers
                        who may have left their own cup at home or didn’t want to carry a reusable cup around all day, it also helped us learn more about how a scheme can work for
                        our customers and baristas in our stores.</p>
                    <p>Next, we're taking a closer look at how we can build upon and improve this experience, helping us on our journey to deliver an effective reusable cup scheme at
                        scale. Watch this space.</p>

                        offering free refills in all our UK stores. We're proud to have been the first big business to join Refill in 2018, creating over 2,000 Refill stations and giving everyone the 
                        opportunity to make more sustainable choices. Look out for the Refill logo in our store windows. </p>

            <h2>Innovative <span>cup design</span></h2>
            <div>
                <p>As part of an ongoing effort to reduce the environmental impact of our iconic 
                    takeaway cups, in November 2021 we changed the inside lining to plant-based 
                    plastic, rather than an oil-based plastic. The new cups have a 26% lower carbon 
                    footprint than a standard takeaway cup when recycled, which you can do at 
                    any Costa Coffee store nationwide – just hand them over to your barista or pop
                    them in a cup recycling bin.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>We also replaced our plastic straws with a paper-based alternative and in 
                    Spring 2022 launched a 150-store trial of a new recyclable fibre lid for our hot 
                    takeaway drinks. Available across small, medium and large drinks sizes, the lids 
                    are made from renewable plant-based material and have up to 50% lower 
                    carbon footprint than the current polystyrene plastic version. </p>

            <h2>Cup <span>recycling</span></h2>
            <p>We understand that coffee cups pose an industry-wide problem as the plastic lining in the cup means they cannot be thrown into standard mixed recycling bins. 
                Instead, cups must be collected separately to be recycled at any of the four recycling facilities within the UK.</p>
            <p>As the UK's largest coffee shop brand, we wanted to do something to address this recycling challenge. In 2016, we became the first coffee chain to introduce 
                recycling points in all our stores. That's why we encouraged customers to recycle any paper takeaway cup via one of our 2,700+ stores up and down the country. 
                And we're not precious about the brand of disposable cup you bring to us either. Even if it’s not a Costa Coffee branded cup, we’ll take care of it and ensure its 
                recycled.</p>
            <p>Not satisfied with stopping there, just two years later we partnered with Valpak (an independent waste management service company) to launch the UK’s National 
                Cup Recycling Scheme. Through this scheme, we pay waste collectors an incentive for every tonne of cups they collect, which helps to fund the right infrastructure 
                and processes for cups to be recovered for recycling.</p>
            <p>So far, the scheme has helped to recycle over 165 million cups and has resulted in more places like offices, shopping centres, universities, transport hubs and local 
                councils provide cup recycling facilities. We are also thrilled that the scheme is now supported by more of the UK’s leading coffee brands, as we know that working 
                in collaboration is the best way to increase recycling rates.</p>
            <p>We are determined to recycle as many cups as possible, and we will continue to roll out dedicated cup recycling points to as many of our stores as possible.</p>
