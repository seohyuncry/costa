                    <p>These groups do some fantastic work individually, but also put real effort into 
                        staying connected and collaborating – because we know that people’s identities

                        <p>Shine is our LGBT+ network community, supporting our LGBT+ team members 
                            and allies.</p>
                        <p>Each year, Costa Coffee teams represent the company at PRIDE events, and we’
                            ve nailed our inclusive colours to the mast by releasing some special-edition 
                            PRIDE products in celebration of our LGBT+ teams, allies and customers. 
                            We also spread our PRIDE activity into our stores, with dedicated PRIDE days held 
                            each year to enable our teams to celebrate PRIDE with their customers in their 
                            own wonderful ways.</p>
                        <p>In 2019, we established our partnership with Switchboard LGB+ Helpline, a UK 
                            based charity providing a helpline and online chat service to the LGBT+ 
                            community, 365 days a year. We have an ongoing commitment to support them, 
                            and each year, £1 donation from the sale of each rainbow reusable cup goes 
                            directly to the charity.</p>
                        <p>In 2020 we extended our range of PRIDE merchandise and made it available in 
                            all UK stores, in response to customer feedback.</p>

                        <h3>INSIDE OUT</h3>
                        <p>We know that focusing on wellbeing means being able to talk openly about our
                            whole selves – both inside and out. That’s why our Inside Out network focuses
                            on creating safe spaces for our team members to talk about their physical
                            and mental wellbeing alongside disability and neurodiversity.</p>
                        <p>The network team works to create a supportive community that welcomes
                            participants from across our entire business by hosting events, listening and
                            networking sessions. They also share vital information on how to access
                            resources and support – this includes reminding people how to access our
                            Employee Assistance Programme, provided by our friends at Hospitality Action.</p>

                        <h3>BELONG</h3>
                        <p>Learning from diversity of thought is one of the most important ways that we 
                            are progressing our inclusion agenda. Racism and discrimination of any kind is 
                            not tolerated at Costa – it has no place in society, or in our business. While we 
                            have made progress, there is much more we need to do.</p>
                        <p>Through our internal 'Belong' network, we enable our team members to help us 
                            define and reshape our cultural diversity agenda – as we move forward with a 
                            renewed purpose to be an ally and demonstrate progress.</p>

                            leadership positions.</p>
                        <p>Through open discussions and listening sessions, we gather insight to help make
                            Costa a great place where everyone can thrive in their careers. Our community
                            meets regularly for our Book Club and ‘Popcorn Sessions’ (where we meet to
                            watch a short talk about topics related to gender equality and discuss the
                             themes raised together).</p>
                        <p>These activities take place regularly, alongside celebrations for events like 
                            International Women’s Day and International Men’s Day,
