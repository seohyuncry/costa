            <h2><span>Costa</span> Club</h2>
            <h3>Membership full terms and condititons</h3>
            <p>See here for full Costa Club membership terms and conditions.</p>
            <h3>Refer a Friend</h3>
            <p>This offer is available until further notice by Costa (the "Promoter") to Costa Club members who are GB residents, over 16 years of age and who have registered to 
                use the Costa Club app (the "App"). All participants will be deemed to have accepted these terms and conditions in full. These terms and conditions should be 
                read, where applicable, together with the Costa Club terms and conditions (the "Costa Club Terms") which can be found here.</p>
            <p>1. Registered members of the Costa Club who have downloaded the App (each a potential "Referrer") can invite a friend ("Recipient") to download the App and join 
                the Costa Club by following the on-screen instructions at the “invite your friends to the app” section of the App. The App will create a unique invitation ("Invite or 
                Invitation") which can be sent to a Recipient by the Referrer. The Invitation contains a link to the App and a unique invitation code for the Recipient. Please note that 
                both a Recipient and a Referrer must have a mobile device with an internet connection which is capable of downloading the App in order to participate.</p>
            <p>2. Before the Referrer invites a friend to join the Club as part of any promotion operated by us, please only do so with their prior consent. Don’t spam them. The 
                Referrer must ask for the Recipients’ consent before forwarding any invitation or Club access link to them.</p>
            <p>3. A Recipient must download the App via the link in the Invitation and (provided they comply with the requirements of the Costa Club Terms) sign up to become a 
                member of the Costa Club.</p>
            <p>4. In order for both the Recipient and the Referrer to receive the benefits set out at paragraph 4 below, the Recipient must:<br>
                a) have consented to receive the invitation from the Referrer<br>
                b) follow the link provided in the Invitation to download the App;<br>
                c) as part of registering for the Costa Club on the App, provide the unique invitation code from the Invitation at the appropriate part of the sign-up process; and<br>
                d) make a bean earning purchase in accordance with the Costa Club Terms. For the avoidance of doubt, this means the Recipient needs to make a purchase of:<br>
                (i) a handcrafted drink (i.e. any handcrafted drink which is on the menu board at a Costa outlet) from a participating Costa outlet in Great Britain;<br>
                (ii) a bundle deal drink (i.e. any drink which is included in any bundle deal) from a participating Costa outlet in Great Britain;<br>
                (iii) a drink from a Costa Express machine in Great Britain; or<br>
                (iv) any drinks purchased at (i) to (iii) above (inclusive) via Click & Collect and/or Contactless Ordering (see Contactless Ordering and Click & Collect sections of<br>
                the Costa Club Terms),<br>
                and scan or otherwise use the App when making any purchase referred to at (i) to (iv) above (inclusive) ("Qualifying Purchase").</p>
            <p>5. If the Recipient complies with all of the requirements of paragraph 3 above, both the Recipient and the Referrer will have five (5) beans added to their Costa Club 
                account within 48 hours of the Recipient making a Qualifying Purchase. Costa Club beans are issued strictly in accordance with the Costa Club Terms.</p>
            <p>6. There is no limit to the number of Recipients a Referrer can invite to download the App and register for the Costa Club. However, each Recipient must comply with 
                the Costa Club Terms. For the avoidance of doubt, each person you invite must be a GB resident over 16 years of age and must not already be a member of the 
                Costa Club. Please note that the Costa Club Terms provide that an individual may only register one membership.</p>
            <p>7. No cash alternative. Costa Club beans are non-transferable and cannot be resold.</p>
            <p>8. The Promoter processes your personal data in connection with the offer for the purposes of administering and managing the offer. This processing is in order to 
                fulfil a contract or take steps linked to a contract (and if it is not provided, you may not be able to enter into, or the Promoter may not be able to fulfil, the contract). 
                Additional information about the purposes for which the Promoter processes personal data, how it is processed and data protection rights (including the right to 
                object in circumstances) are set out in the Promoter’s Privacy Policy, a copy of which can be found here.</p>
            <p>9. The Promoter reserves the right to withdraw or amend the terms of this offer at any time. Notice of the withdrawal of the offer or the amendment of its terms will 
                be posted on the App. The withdrawal or amendment of the offer will not affect Referrers or Recipients who have already earned beans in accordance with the 
                terms of the offer before the offer is withdrawn or amended.</p>
            <p>10. The Promoter also reserves the right to withdraw, alter or suspend the offer at any time with or without notice if circumstances beyond its control make this 
                unavoidable.</p>
            <p>11. The Promoter reserves the right at any time, in its absolute discretion to: (i) verify the eligibility of: (a) any Referrer; and (b) each Recipient (including their age 
                and place of residence); and (ii) to disqualify any person found to be abusing or tampering with the operation of the offer or endeavouring to earn beans using 
                fraudulent means including (but not limited to) by: (a) a Recipient registering on the App more than once; (b) a Referrer sharing a unique code to more than one 
                Recipient (via posting the unique code on a website, public forum, public social platforms or on the Costa Club page, for example). Please note however that there 
                is no limit to the number of Recipients a Referrer can invite to download the App and register for the Costa Club, but a Referrer should generate a new unique code 
                for each Recipient; or (c) who the Promoter otherwise believes to have acted in breach of these terms and conditions or the Costa Club Terms.</p>
            <p>12. If the Promoter fails to comply with these terms and conditions, the promoter is responsible for loss or damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of the 
                Promoter's breach of these terms and conditions or its negligence, but it is not responsible for any loss or damage that is not foreseeable. Loss or damage is 
                foreseeable if they were an obvious consequence of the promoter's breach or if they were contemplated by you and the promoter at the time that you entered 
                the offer.</p>
            <p>13. Save where required by law, the Promoter accepts no responsibility or liability for any failure to comply with these terms and conditions for reasons beyond its 
                control and accepts no responsibility or liability for any attempt to register with or to log-in the App which is unsuccessful or incomplete for technical or other 
                reasons beyond its control.</p>
            <p>14. The offer and these terms and conditions, and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with them, shall be governed by and construed in accordance 
                with English law and you can bring legal proceedings in respect of the offer and these terms and conditions in the English courts. If you live in Scotland you can 
                bring legal proceedings in respect of the offer and these terms and conditions in either the Scottish or the English courts.</p>
            <p>15. The Promoter is Costa Limited. Registered office address: 3 Knaves Beech Business Centre, Davies Way, Loudwater, High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, HP10 9QR.

                will expire seven (7) days after the date that it was issued. See here for full terms and conditions.</p>
            <h3>Gift a Reward</h3>
            <p>1. Under the Costa Club Membership terms, when you earn eight (8) beans you will receive a ‘Free Drink’ Reward. You are now entitled to share that Reward, if you 
                wish, with a friend through the Costa Club app ‘Gift a Reward’ functionality.</p>
            <p>2. You must be a member of the Costa Club and have the Costa Club app to be able to share the Reward with a friend.</p>
            <p>3. There is no maximum amount of Rewards you are able to share with a friend, however you will only be permitted to share five (5) Rewards with a friend at any 
                one time through the Costa Club app. If you wish to share more, you will need to access the Costa Club app an additional time to make this transfer.</p>
            <p>4. You will be able to share the Reward via social media direct message channels, email or instant messaging.</p>
            <p>5. If you share a Reward with a friend, it will be removed from your Costa Club app once it has been accepted by your friend, and you shall not be entitled to also 
                use that Reward. If you use the Reward prior to it being accepted by your friend in the Costa Club app, your friend will no longer receive the Reward. If you share 
                one Reward with multiple friends, the first friend to enter the code on their Costa Club app will redeem that reward and it will become unavailable to any others you 
                have shared it with.</p>
            <p>6. If you receive a notification that a friend has shared a Reward with you and you are:<br>
                a) not a Costa Club member, to redeem the Reward, you will be required to: (i) download the Costa Club app; and (b) register as a member of the Costa Club; or<br>
                b) a Costa Club member, the reward will automatically appear as a ‘Free Drink’ in the rewards section on the Costa Club app.</p>
            <p>7. Once a Reward has been shared with you, you can choose to redeem the Reward or you can transfer the Rewards to any other person in accordance with these 
                terms and conditions.</p>
            <p>8. The Rewards: (a) cannot be used more than once; (b) is only valid for three (3) months from the date on which they are issued and (c) can only be redeemed 
                against handcrafted drinks purchased in-store at participating Costa outlets.</p>
            <p>9. For further details regarding earning beans and redeeming Rewards, see the full Costa Club Membership terms here.</p>
            <p>10. The promoter reserves the right to amend, suspend or withdraw the promotion at any time without prior notice if circumstances beyond its control make this 
                unavoidable.</p>
            <p>11. The promoter shall not be liable for any failure to comply with these terms and conditions as a consequence of events beyond its reasonable control.</p>

            <p>1.1 By accessing the Wifi service, you confirm that you accept these terms. If you do not agree to these terms, you must not access the Wifi service. We may amend 
                these terms from time to time, so you should check these terms regularly to ensure you understand which terms apply.</p>

            <p>2.1 We give you access to the WiFi service free of charge.</p>

                bugs or viruses. Access to the WiFi service is permitted on an "as is" and "as available" basis. We may suspend or withdraw or restrict your access to the WiFi service

                are not obliged to do so.</p>
            <span>3. Our responsibility for loss or damage suffered by you</span>
            <p>3.1 We do not exclude or limit in any way our liability to you where it would be unlawful to do so. This includes liability for death or personal injury caused by our 
                negligence or the negligence of our employees, agents or subcontractors and for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.</p>
            <p>3.2 Please note that we only provide access to the WiFi service for domestic and private use. You agree not to access or use the WiFi service for any commercial or 
                business purposes, and we have no liability to you for any loss of profit, loss of revenue, loss of business, business interruption, or loss of business opportunity.</p>
            <p>3.3 We are not responsible for any loss or damage that is not foreseeable. Loss or damage is foreseeable if it was an obvious consequence of our breach or if it was 
                contemplated by you and us at the time that you accessed the WiFi service.</p>
            <span>4. Your use of the Wifi Service</span>

                information;</p>

                Content") must comply with the following rules:</p>
            <p>4.3.1 it must not be obscene, abusive, offensive or racist and it must not promote or propose hatred or physical harm against anyone;</p>
            <p>4.3.2 it must not harass or bully another person;</p>
            <p>4.3.3 it must be true and honest so far as you know;</p>

                footage or music (unless it is your own);</p>
            <p>4.3.6 it must not contain someone else’s personal details or confidential information relating to other people; and</p>
            <p>4.3.7 it must not promote or condone terrorism, violence or illegal behaviour.</p>
            <p>4.4 You must not misuse the WiFi service by knowingly introducing viruses, trojans, worms, logic bombs or other material which is malicious or technologically 
                harmful. You must not attempt to gain unauthorised access to the WiFi service, the server on which the WiFi service is stored or any server, computer or database 
                connected to the WiFi service. You must not attack the WiFi service via a denial-of-service attack or a distributed denial-of service attack. By breaching this 
                provision, you would commit a criminal offence under the Computer Misuse Act 1990. We will report any such breach to the relevant law enforcement authorities 
                and we will co-operate with those authorities by disclosing your identity to them.</p>
            <p>4.5 If you breach the terms set out above, your right to use the WiFi service will cease immediately.</p>
            <span>5. Your responsibility for loss or damage suffered by us</span>
            <p>5.1 You will fully compensate us against all losses, costs, proceedings, damages, expenses (including reasonable legal costs and expenses) or liability that we may 
                suffer as a result of your use of the WiFi service.</p>
            <span>6. Other important terms</span>
            <p>6.1 Each of the clauses of these terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining 
                clauses will remain in full force and effect.</p>
            <p>6.2 If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under these terms, or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will 
                not mean that we have waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a default by you, we 
                will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you.</p>
            <span>7. Which country's laws apply to any disputes?</span>
            <p>7.1 These terms are governed by the laws of England and Wales. This means that your access to the WiFi service, and any dispute or claim arising out of or in 
                connection therewith (including non-contractual disputes or claims), will be governed by English law.</p>
            <p>7.2 You can bring proceedings in respect of these terms in the English courts. However, as a consumer, if you live in another European Union member state you can 
                bring legal proceedings in respect of these terms in either the English courts or the courts of that Member State.</p>
            <span>8. How we use your personal data</span>
            <p>8.1 Any personal data that Costa collects as part of your use of the WiFi service at a Costa Store.</p>
            <p>8.2 This may include the ID number of your device and location data sent from the device you use to access the WiFi service. We will use this personal data in 
                accordance with Costa’s privacy policy.</p>
