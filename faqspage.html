            <h3><span>Costa</span> Club</h3>
            <span>How do I earn Beans, where and on what products?</span>
            <P>You will earn Beans for any size barista made drink (hot or cold) that you purchase from any Costa Coffee store and any of the 11,000 + drink Costa Express 
                machines located in Great Britain (excluding Northern Ireland).</P>
            <P>If you purchase multiple barista made drinks in one transaction, you’ll receive the number of beans that corresponds to the number of barista made drinks 
                purchased. For example, if you purchase a single Espresso, a large caramel Macchiato, and a medium oat milk Latte in store you will receive three Beans in return.</P>
            <P>You will also be able to earn Beans when you place an order for a barista made drink via Click & Collect and contactless ordering via any Costa Express machines.</P>
            <P>Plus, every time you buy a barista made drink (hot or cold) in a reusable cup, we’ll give you an extra Bean. This means after only five drinks in a reusable cup, you’ll 
                earn one for free!</P>
            <span>How long do I have to redeem the Beans I earn and exclusive offers, such as a 
                free sweet treat on my birthday?</span>
            <p>Beans collected via the updated Costa Club rewards scheme will expire if a member has not used the mobile app or the Club Card to either earn Beans or redeem 
                free drinks rewards for 12 months since the last transaction.</p>
            <p>Currently, free drinks can only be redeemed from a Costa Coffee store only in Great Britain (excluding Northern Ireland). Free drink rewards earned via collecting 
                Beans, will expire three months after they have been issued.</p>
            <p>If you provided a valid date of birth when you registered for the Costa Club either on the Costa app or via the website and agreed to receive marketing 
                communications from Costa Coffee, we’ll add a reward for a free treat from our sweet counter to your account in time for your birthday. You can redeem your Free 
                Birthday Treat reward any day up to seven days after your registered birthday, with no other purchase required.</p>
            <p>You can use the ‘Free Birthday Treat’ reward on (subject to availability) a single piece/slice/portion (as applicable) of fresh cake, muffins, sweet pastries, tarts, 
                teacakes, traybakes, cookies/shortbread, buns, doughnuts, on ice cream, or any sweet gluten free products. Excludes whole cakes.</p>
            <p>You do not need to purchase an item to receive your free treat from our sweet counter birthday reward.</p>
            <span>How do I earn double Beans by using a resuable cup?</span>
            <p>Every time you buy a barista made drink (Hot or Cold) in a reusable cup we’ll give you an extra Bean. This means after only five drinks in a reusable cup, you’ll earn 
                one for free!</p>
            <span>Do I need to be a Costa Club member to use the app?</span>
            <p>To start collecting and redeeming Beans, new customers can register for a Costa Club account via the app or online. Becoming a member also protects your 
                Beans should anything happen to your card or device and you’ll also have access to exclusive rewards and other Costa Club benefits.</p>
            <p>Existing Costa Club members can simply sign in.</p>
            <span>How can I get the Costa Club app?</span>
            <p>The Costa Club app is free and available for iPhone, iPad, and Android users. You can download the app here or by simply searching for 'Costa' on the App Store or 
                Google Play.</p>
            <p>If you ever change or lose your device, simply reinstall the Costa Club app to your new system, log in as normal and you’re ready to go!</p>
            <span>How do I use the app in store?</span>
            <p>If you’re a new customer, once you’ve downloaded the app, you can then register for a Costa Club account to start collecting Beans by scanning your device.</p>
            <p>To start collecting Beans in store, simply open the app and tap 'Shop' at the top of the screen. Then scan your phone at the till whenever you make a purchase and 
                you'll receive a free Bean automatically. You'll get 1 Bean with every Costa crafted drink you buy. Just collect 10 Beans to get a free drink!</p>
            <p>You’ll find that many of our stores already have scanners, and more are coming soon, but if for any reason you cannot collect Beans in-store via the app, you can 
                ask the barista for a receipt and your beans can be added retrospectively on your next visit.</p>
            <span>How do I use the app at Express machines?</span>
            <p>If you’re using an Express machine, order your drink as normal and then open your Costa Coffee app and select ‘Machine’ at the top of the app. Whilst your drink is 
                being made, tap 'Collect beans only' and scan the code displayed on the machine's screen.</p>
            <p>Your Beans will then be added automatically to your Costa Club account. Unfortunately, Beans can only be collected from Express machines and cannot be 
                redeemed at this moment in time. You can still use all the Beans you’ve collected in one of our stores.</p>
            <p>In most cases, your Beans total will update immediately, and always within a few minutes. If you find you don't have an internet connection, your Beans will update 
                later when you do.</p>
            <span>I'm experiencing issues with the app</span>
            <p>If the scan on your device fails whilst using the app at a till, check with the barista and try again. Baristas can also add your Beans retrospectively if the issue 
                continues, just request a receipt at payment.</p>
            <p>If you’re using the app at an Express machine and the scan on your device fails, please try again and double check that you are connected to Wi-fi. If the issues 
                continue please request a receipt and contact Customer Services via our contact form.</p>
            <span>Can I keep using my card in conjunction with the app?</span>
            <p>Absolutely! Beans can be collected with both the card and the app and will count towards your balance.</p>
            <span>How do I update my account information?</span>
            <p>Want to let us know you've changed your details? No problem, you can manage your profile on the app or by logging into your account via our website and 
                clicking the 'Details' tab icon. Changes to your password can also be managed within this section.</p>
            <span>I have logged into my account and can see my card number but also another 
                number I do not recognise?</span>
            <p>When you register an account, this will automatically generate a digital account number along with your card. Please note that this number will be synced to your 
                plastic card number, so you will continue to earn Beans as normal.</p>
            <span>How can I replace my lost or damaged card?</span>
            <p>If you have the Costa Coffee app downloaded to your device, you can continue using it to collect Beans in-store or at any Express machine. If you are unable to 
                use our app to continue enjoying the benefits of our scheme, you can get in touch with our Customer Services team using our contact form.</p>
            <span>I have transferred my balance form my lost card onto my new card, but my 
                rewards have disappered?</span>
            <p>If you haven’t used your card in the last 12 months your Beans may have been lost as per our terms and conditions. Free drinks rewards will expire after 3 months of 
                being earned. Get in touch with us here and we can look into this for you.</p>
            <span>Will I have to register my new card once I have transferred the balance from my 
                lost card?</span>
            <p>No. Once the balance has been transferred your new card will be automatically registered to your existing account. Unfortunately, you won't receive another bonus 
                Bean as these are only issued when you create a brand-new account.</p>
            <span>Does my card have an expiry date?</span>
            <p>No. However, if inactive for a period of 12 months or more, your card will become invalid and the remaining Beans will not be transferable to a new card and cannot 
                be refunded.</p>

            <h3><span>Click</span> & Collect</h3>
            <span>What is Click & Collect?</span>
            <p>Click & Collect is a new feature of the Costa Coffee app, enabling you to place and pay for an order at a nearby Costa Coffee right from your phone and then 
                collect it in-store.</p>
            <span>Is Click & Collect available in all Costa Coffee stores?</span>
            <p>Click & Collect is now available at over 500 Costa Coffee stores nationwide. Keep an eye out for more stores coming soon.</p>
            <span>Why don't I see all the menu items on the Costa Coffee app menu?</span>
            <p>We currently offer nearly all of our most popular menu board drinks and a large range of our favourite food items. The range will be regularly reviewed and 
                updated.</p>
            <span>I have a plastic card and the app; can I carry on using my plastic card when I place a Click & Collect order?</span>
            <p>Click & Collect orders can only be made via the app.</p>
            <span>Are there any payment cards that you don't accept as payment with Click & 
                Collect?</span>
            <p>Unfortunately, we can't accept American Express or any non-UK cards to pay for Click & Collect orders.</p>
            <span>Can I add my Costa Club card to Apple and Google Wallets?</span>
            <p>Yes, you can! Simply open the app, ensure you are logged in, then select 'add to Apple Wallet' on iPhone or ‘add to Google Pay’ on Android devices.</p>
            <span>Do I need a WiFi or 3G/4G connection to place a Click & Collect order?</span>
            <p>If you’re placing an order and making a payment through the app, you’ll need to ensure you have a 3G, 4G, or WiFi connection.</p>
            <span>Will I still get my Costa Club Beans when I place a Click & Collect order?</span>
            <p>Yes, your Beans will be added as usual and these should update on your app within a few minutes for every drink you have purchased.</p>
            <span>When will my Click & Collect order be ready?</span>
            <p>Before you submit your order to your chosen store, we’ll give you an estimated amount of time that it will take for your order to be ready.</p>
            <span>I'm running late; can I change my Click & Collect order?</span>
            <p>Unfortunately, once your order is submitted, it can't be changed. If your order hasn’t been collected within 15 minutes of the estimated delivery time, it will be 
                disposed of and can no longer be collected. You will not be refunded.</p>
            <span>Where do I go in store to collect my Click & Collect order?</span>
            <p>Once you've placed your order through the Costa Coffee app you'll need to look out for and follow the 'Collection only' floor signs to the Collection Point when inside 
                the store. Please also make sure to follow the signs outside the store if you need to queue before entering.</p>
            <p>A barista will then call your order number when it's ready and invite you to approach the counter to safely collect it.</p>
            <span>Where is my credit card information stored?</span>
            <p>Costa Coffee does not hold any of your financial information. We partner with a PCI:DSS level 1 payment service provider to ensure that your details are held 
                securely with them.</p>
            <span>What do I do if I see suspicious activity on my account?</span>
            <p>If you notice any suspicious activity on your account, please contact our Customer Services Team directly via our online contact us form.</p>
            <span>What processes does Costa Coffee follow to keep my data safe?</span>
            <p>We work hard to ensure that your data is safe with us and have ensured that our Click & Collect system has been independently reviewed and audited for its 
                security. In addition, we handle all your personal data with care and diligence.</p>
            <span>Who should I contact if I have any issues?</span>
            <p>If something's not right, we'd like to hear about it. Please contact our Customer Services Team directly via our online contact us form. If the query is specifically to 
                do with Click & Collect, then please select that as the option from the drop-down menu.</p>

            <p>You can find all our nutrition and allergen information by visiting our menu. If you still need some help, you can get in touch with us here.</p>
            <span>What does reformulation, remove and recommend alternative mean?</span>
            <p>* Reformulate means we will redevelop a products recipe to remove added sugar</p>
            <p>* Remove means we will de-list products (in their entirety) and replace with an alternative where possible</p>
            <p>* Recommend Alternative means we will develop new products to offer healthier choices.</p>
            <span>How much sugar are you reducing from the portfolio?</span>
            <p>As one part of this commitment, since 2015 we have supported Public Health England’s (PHE) 20% by 2020 sugar reduction programme in food and the 20% by 2021 
                sugar reduction programme in milk-based drinks.</p>
            <p>Overall, we have achieved a total sugar reduction of just over 30% across all cup sizes and milk options in our drinks range.</p>
            <span>Why aren’t you reducing added sugar in all drinks that contain it?</span>
            <p>We want to give our customers a wide range and choice in partnership with proactive added sugar reduction. This process is on-going and as we get feedback 
                from our customers we’ll continue to proactively reduce added sugar across our portfolio without compromising on taste.</p>
            <span>Which products are having their added sugar content reduced?</span>
            <p>While our core coffee range contains no added sugar, we have made some significant changes to the rest of the drinks menu through reformulation, introducing 
                more healthier alternatives and reviewing our portion sizes.</p>
            <p>In 2020, we launched a mini cup size with a wider range of great tasting sugar free syrups and we're proud to have achieved a sugar reduction of 20% in our hot 
                chocolate powder since 2015 as well as greatly reducing the calories in our Chai Latte through reformulation and using semi-skimmed milk as the default option.</p>
            <span>What recipe changes are you making? How is sugar being reduced?</span>
            <p>Some drinks recipes are being reformulated with the use of sweetener, Stevia, instead of sugar, whilst others are using sugar-free syrups as part of our new brand 
                standards.</p>
            <span>Why aren’t you bringing down the added sugar content of your food range?</span>
            <p>We continue to look at ways to improve the nutritional value of our food range have a great selection of lower sugar sweet products such as traybakes and muffins 
                and soups, sandwiches and wraps that are less than 400kcals.</p>
            <span>Do you believe that sweeteners are a healthy alternative to refined sugar? Don’t 
                they have their own long-term health risks?</span>
            <p>Research from the European Food Safety Authority into sweeteners shows they are perfectly safe to eat or drink on a daily basis as part of a healthy diet.</p>
            <span>Why don’t you make healthier products cheaper than non healthier products?</span>
            <p>As a business, we can’t subsidise customers’ choices, and we equally don’t charge a premium for healthy choices, our pricing is determined by a cost of sourcing 
                and production among other operating overheads.</p>
            <span>What other nutritional commitments are you making?</span>
            <p>Having met our target of a 5% reduction in salt by 2017, we are continuing our salt reduction programmes and working with Public Health England to ensure that 
                any future targets reflect the role of salt in the manufacture and safety of specific foods such as cheese and bread.</p>
            <p>We are also working with Public Health England on their calorie reduction programme and aim to achieve the overall target of 20% calorie reduction by 2024.</p>
            <p>Finally, we continue to explore ways to communicate the nutritional value of our products with customers to help inform their choices.</p>
