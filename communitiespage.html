                <p>In 2014, we set up a nationwide Community Programme to enable our teams to support the communities we serve. Our nationwide activities focus on social
                    themes that our customers tell us they care about such as litter, loneliness and food waste, and we also encourage our teams to plan their own activities to meet
                    the needs of their specific communities.
                    </p>
                <p>Every store has its own Community Noticeboard where customers and members of the public can put up news and information about activities that are
                    happening in their local area. Plus, with Costa Coffee outlets in over 30 countries around the world, we also support our international stores in similar ways.</p>
                <p>
                    By making the most of our space in-store and drawing on the enthusiasm of our amazing teams, we put huge effort into bringing people together to strengthen
the communities we are part of.

            <p>The challenges many community groups faced during the COVID-19 pandemic were unprecedented and our number one priority has been the safety of our 
                customers and team members. When we took the decision to close our stores, our store teams did a brilliant job of donating surplus food to local food banks, care 
                homes, NHS teams and key workers.</p>
            <p>Over the course of the pandemic, we were able to deliver over 861,000 Ready-To-Drink cans and 40,000 Roast and Ground coffee packs to NHS call centres, 
                hospitals, police and fire stations and other key facilities.</p>
            <p>Our supply chain team also leapt into action to redirect any food we could to people in need, thanks to the support of many amazing charities. We donated over 
                21,000 cases of product across our food range during 2020 and 2021.</p>

                    Hand sanitiser stations are available, we continue to sanitise tables frequently, 
                    and our team members wash their hands every 30 minutes as a minimum.</p>

            <h2>Chatty <span>Café</span></h2>
            <p>In August 2018, we announced that we would be rolling out an initiative called the Chatty Café Scheme across over 300 stores nationally – the first big coffee chain 
                to do so. The Chatty Café Scheme, established by Alex Hoskyn, was set up to tackle the challenge that loneliness brings to many people in the UK.</p>
            <p>Our stores dedicate one table in store as a ‘Chatter and Natter’ table, which is marked with a sign at specific times each week. People who sit at this table are 
                indicating that they are open to chat with someone new.</p>
            <p>We couldn’t believe how much our communities embraced the scheme! We’ve seen tables used for homework clubs, parent and baby groups, police drop-in 
                sessions, and even craft clubs. It’s fantastic to see our warm and welcoming stores also being used as social and community hubs, all facilitated by our brilliant 
                team members.</p>

            <h2>Litter</h2>
            <p>As the Nation’s Favourite* Coffee shop, it's our responsibility to operate in a way that respects the planet. In addition to our continuing efforts to reduce waste and
                find new ways to recycle, we are also committed to tackling litter in our local communities.</p>
            <p>We were among the first signatories of Keep Britain Tidy’s Litter Prevention Commitment back in 2015, which involves raising awareness of the problem of litter, 
                encouraging people to do the right thing when disposing of their rubbish, and to take positive action to reduce the cost of cleaning up litter. We also collaborate 
                closely with Keep Wales Tidy and Keep Scotland Beautiful to encourage our teams and customers to play a part in clearing up litter, for example in 2020 and 
                in 2021. </p>
            <p>We've participated in the Great British Spring Clean for the past six years and continue to support litter picking events throughout the year, helping to reduce the 
                impact of litter in our communities. We were also proud to support DEFRA’s ‘Keep it, Bin it’ message by reminding people to recycle their takeaway cups and 
                partnered with Keep Scotland Beautiful to encourage customers to #TakeItHome. </p>
            <p>Industry-wide collaborations are also vital to tackling this issue, so we’ve worked closely with Hubbub, a social enterprise who use behaviour change techniques to
                drive consumer action. Projects in Edinburgh, London, Swansea and Leeds have led to significant changes in how consumers dispose of their litter and have
                created templates for other cities to follow when it comes to tackling on the go recycling.</p>
            <p>Litter continues to be a hugely important social and environmental challenges across the UK, and we will continue to protect and preserve our local community
                spaces by encouraging people to dispose of their rubbish in a responsible way. This includes recycling our takeaway coffee cups and encouraging reusable cups.</p>
