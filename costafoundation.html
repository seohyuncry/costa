                            over £20 million by calculation. In addition, as the world's second largest 
                            coffeehouse chain after Starbucks, it won many awards related to coffee 
                            from 2009 to 2015.</p>

                            has done a lot of good work by educating 100,000 children. It helped to 
                            create a facility that made children, including customers, feel

                            838 classrooms in 10 countries, providing educational opportunities for

            <h2>Change a <span>child's life story</span></h2>
            <p>Education is the key to changing children’s life stories, so we're working hard to build quality schools. They are built in some of the world’s most remote communities,
                with locations carefully chosen to provide support where it is most needed.</p>
            <p>The Costa Foundation supports these communities without expecting anything in return, which means we are often helping farmers in areas where we are not able 
                to buy coffee. We don’t do things by halves, and we definitely don’t do average. Our fundraising builds brilliant schools for amazing young people.</p>
            <p>10 different countries across the coffee belt now benefit from a Costa Foundation school project, including Colombia, Uganda and Vietnam. We’re really proud of all 
                that the charity has achieved so far and are looking forward to changing the life stories of even more children in the future.</p>

            <h2>Get <span>involved</span></h2>
            <p>The Costa Foundation is only able to keep building schools because our incredible team members put so much enthusiasm and effort into fundraising all year
                round, and thanks to the continued generosity of our customers and suppliers. Find out more about our fundraising below and learn more about the impact
                this is having on children around the world by visiting the Costa Foundation website.</p>

                    When Jennifer lost her parents, she had to drop out of school to support 
                    herself and her two younger brothers. Thanks to the Costa Foundation, 
                    Jennifer is back in school. Follow the links below to see other people who

                        <p>There's one especially important moment in our fundraising calendar 
                            that we look forward to: our iconic 3 Peaks Challenge. Our teams, 
                            suppliers and partners gather to participate: whether that’s by walking, 
                            driving or simply supporting the event. In recent years, generous 
                            donations have meant that we are able to build a whole new school 
                            from 3 Peaks fundraising alone!</p>
